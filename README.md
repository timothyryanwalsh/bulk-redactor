## Identify, review, and remove sensitive files.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timothyryanwalsh/bulk-reviewer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/timothyryanwalsh/bulk-reviewer)

**Note: This software is still in development and is not production ready.**

Bulk Reviewer is a software program that aids in identification, review, and removal of sensitive files in directories and disk images. Bulk Reviewer scans directories and disk images for personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive information using [bulk_extractor](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor), a best-in-class digital forensics tool, and can optionally extract named entities (personal names as well as nationalities, religions, and political affiliations) using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/). A browser application enables users to configure, start, and review scans, generate reports, and export files, separating problematic files (e.g., those requiring redaction or further review) from those that are free of sensitive information.

Bulk Reviewer consists of two separate applications that communicate via websockets and a REST API:

* A backend application `server` built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/), [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/), [Django Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), [Redis](https://redis.io/) and [RabbitMQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RabbitMQ).
* A frontend single page application (SPA) `client` built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Currently, Bulk Reviewer can scan directories and disk images for:

* Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
* Credit card numbers
* Email addresses
* Phone numbers
* URLs, web domains, RFC822 headers, and HTTP logs
* GPS data
* EXIF metadata
* Personal names
* Names of nationalities, religions, and political affiliations
* User-supplied regular expressions

Scanners planned but not yet implemented include:

* Canadian Social Insurance Number (SIN) and other national identifiers
* Banking information
* Personal health information
* Facebook and Outlook data
* Additional lexicons (like [those developed by the ePADD project team](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd/community/lexicon-working-group))

Contributions are welcome!

Initial development of Bulk Reviewer occurred while the author, Tim Walsh, was a 2018 Summer Fellow at the [Library Innovation Lab](https://lil.law.harvard.edu) at Harvard University. The application is designed to aid archivists and librarians in processing and providing access to digital collections but may be useful in other domains as well. The application is currently under active development, and is still in the exploratory/prototype phase.

## Development installation

Requires [Docker CE](https://www.docker.com/community-edition), [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org/). 

Minimum resources required to be allocated to Docker for development (higher specs are recommended; bulk_extractor performance will increase linearly with additional CPUs, spaCy NLP performance will increase with additional RAM):

* 2 CPUs
* 8 GB RAM

### Clone repository to local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/timothyryanwalsh/bulk-reviewer.git
cd bulk-reviewer
```

### Set environment variables

```
bash init-default.sh
```

This script copies `server/br_sample.env` to `br.env`, which is used to set environment variables for Django and Postgres. To modify the values for the Postgres database name, username, and password, change the appropriate values in the resulting `br.env` file prior to starting the Docker containers.

### Configure docker-compose volumes

The current configuration for sharing data between the host development machine and the `server` and `worker` Docker containers assumes a macOS development environment. Development in Linux or Windows may require changing the volume configuration to be appropriate for the local machine:

```
- /Users:/Users
- /Volumes:/Volumes
```

These two volumes are used only for giving the `worker` and `server` containers access to data to scan with bulk_extractor. For development on Linux or Windows, change these two volumes for the `worker` and `server` containers in `docker-compose.yml` to appropriate values such as `- /home:/home` (Linux) or `- C:\Users:/Users` (Windows) - this will determine which directories/files are accessible to Bulk Reviewer from the host machine.

### Start containers

```
docker-compose up -d
```

The first time you do this, it will take a while (on my laptop, around 10 minutes). Much of this time is spent installing dependencies for and then building bulk_extractor.

### Start frontend development server

```
cd client
```
Install node_modules (required first time only):

```
npm install
```

Start webpack dev server:

```
npm run serve
```

### Open application in browser

Open [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) in your browser (any recent version of Firefox or Chrome).

### Tox

To run Tox/flake8 locally, create a `/usr/share/bulk_extractor` (Linux) or `/usr/local/share/bulk_extractor` (macOS) directory and move the helper scripts in the `server/bulk_extractor` directory into it. This will place required Python DFXML libraries into their expected paths; otherwise you may encounter module import errors.
